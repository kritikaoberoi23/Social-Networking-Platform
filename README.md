# Java-Based Social Media Platform

A *Java-based social media platform* developed to simulate real-world online social interactions between users.  
The application models *users as nodes* and *relationships (friends/followers) as connections*, enabling profile creation, networking, and content sharing.

## 🚀 Features
- User Signup & Login (Authentication)
- Create and Manage User Profiles
- Follow / Friend Other Users
- Post Text Content
- View Activity Feed
- Basic Search for Users
- Secure Database Integration

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (Java)
- Graph-based Relationships (User Connections)
- Java Collections Framework
- JDBC & SQL Database Connectivity
- Authentication & Authorization Logic
- MVC Architecture (optional)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- *Language:* Java  
- *Database:* MySQL  
- *Backend:* JDBC  
- *IDE:* Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA

## ⚙ How It Works
- Each user is treated as a node in a social graph.
- Friend/Follower relationships form edges between users.
- User actions (posts, follows) update the database and feed dynamically.

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project into your Java IDE
3. Configure MySQL database and update credentials
4. Run the main class

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Likes and Comments
- Private Messaging
- Friend Suggestions using Graph Algorithms (BFS/DFS)
- REST API Integration
- Frontend using JavaFX or Web UI
